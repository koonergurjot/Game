# Audit Findings — Snapshot

**Scope reviewed:** `/games/*`, `/shared/*`, `/js/*`, `/health/*`, `games.json` (legacy `data/games-normalized.json` removed)

## High‑impact issues
1) **Multiple catalogs present** (`/games.json`, `/public/games.json`, `/data/games-normalized.json`) — risk of drift and broken links. _(Resolved: `/games.json` is now the sole source, with `/public/games.json` handled via a compat shim.)_
2) **Inconsistent game shell wiring** — some games rely on `game-shell.js`, others on ad-hoc loaders. Leads to UI layout drift and missing diagnostics wiring.
3) **Diagnostics not guaranteed** — `diag-upgrades.js` exists, but not every game auto-wires it.
4) **Canvas/layout mismatch** — certain pages miss consistent centering/sizing; `game-shell.css` is present but not uniformly applied.
5) **Loading UX stalls** — “Still loading…” states without a timeout/escape; need `GAME_ERROR` surfacing with a visible action.
6) **Asset preloads under-used** — `games.json` has `firstFrame` hints but pages don’t consistently preload those assets.
7) **Offline & cache confusion** — multiple health pages exist, but cache bust/reset not always obvious to end users.
8) **Iframe messaging inconsistencies** — some games post messages (`IFRAME_LOADED`, `GAME_READY`) but not consistently.

## Medium / low issues
- Mixed use of absolute vs relative paths (e.g., `/shared/*` vs `../shared/*`) creates portability issues when hosting under a subpath.
- Occasional missing ARIA labels / keyboard shortcuts on in-game menus.
- Asset 404 detection is manual; better to automate checks.

## Recommendations (see full chat message for details)
- Single source of truth for catalog; add a small shim for backward-compat keys if needed.
- Normalize all game HTML entries to the same shell snippet.
- Universal diagnostics autowire to avoid manual edits.
- Adopt a standard `GAME_READY`/`GAME_ERROR` crumb with a retry button.
- Add `catalog-verifier` & `runlist` health pages to accelerate QA.
