# Screenshots

For consistent screenshots:

- Use a clean browser window at 1280x720 resolution.
- Disable browser extensions and UI overlays.
- Save images as PNG with descriptive names, e.g., `tetris-start.png`.
- Store screenshots in `docs/images/` and reference them with relative paths.
 
## Landing Page and Logo

The new landing page displays a grid of game cards beneath a vibrant pixel-style logo.
Each card shows the game's icon, title, and tags, providing a quick overview of available titles.
