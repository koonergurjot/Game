# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Initial community documents and documentation structure.

### Changed
- Updated the service worker cache naming to follow the scoped `gg-v3_2-*` convention so stale caches are purged reliably.

### Removed
- Removed unused legacy helpers (`POLISH_PACK_MANIFEST.json`, `importmap.html`, and `sw-patch.txt`) to reduce clutter in the repository.
