## 🎯 Project Goal

Our mission is to build a friendly, open playground for accessible HTML5 games. By providing reusable tools and a welcoming space, we aim to spark creativity and help developers share their work with players everywhere. Explore the codebase to learn and contribute: [scripts/](scripts/), [shared/](shared/), [tests/](tests/).

## ✨ Features

- **Curated game library** – browse and launch games from a unified interface that works on desktop and mobile.
- **Game loader with diagnostics** – `js/game-loader.js` boots each game and surfaces clear error messages when something goes wrong.
- **Service Worker caching** – a network‑first strategy keeps JavaScript fresh while enabling offline support for assets.
- **Accessible design** – semantic HTML, ARIA labels and responsive layouts provide an inclusive experience.
